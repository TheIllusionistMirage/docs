## Description

The Koding Community Docs are a community grown documentation project centered
around [Koding](https://koding.com), an Online Development Environment that
aims to bring free development and computing to all.

This documentation effort is in two parts.
[Guides](http://koding.github.io/docs) and
[Wiki](https://github.com/koding/docs/wiki). The goal of
the Guides is to have a large series of tutorial & video pairs which go over
complete instructions on overcoming a common problem, common
confusion, or just general information in Koding. The Wikis on the otherhand
do what Wikis do best, community driven information. A little less organized
sometimes, but nevertheless still quite needed.

With the two, we hope to have one of the most supportive and informative
communities available to all, over at [Koding](https://koding.com). :)
