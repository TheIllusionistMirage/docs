This guide will go over the foundation of what Koding Apps are, from a
programming perspective. By the end of this, you should know how to create a
basic hello world app. We will not explain the KDFramework in this series
step.

If you're looking for a more general example check out the
[Koding Apps Overview][0].

## What are Koding apps

Koding apps are essentially WebApps for your VM. More precisely, when you open
a Koding App a single JavaScript file is ran on your browser. It uses the
KDFramework to then add content to your Koding session, as well as
communicate to your VM to install/save/edit/delete/etc.

## File structure

When you refresh the app list what is actually happening is Koding is looking
for folders located in `~/Applications` with a `manifest.json` file. This
json file contains all of the information about an application, and Koding
uses that to load the app name, version, thumbnails, etc.

Along with this manifest file there will be an `index.js` file which is the
JavaScript file we mentioned earlier. This file is actually a compiled file,
generated from the source CoffeeScript files.

## Creating a Hello World application

As we've seen, there are two required files that need to be created for an app
to exist. Lets create a very stripped down version of these files.

First, create a directory located at `~/Applications/hello.kdapp`,
and navigate there.

### Manifest File

Next, copy the contents of the following code block, and place them in a file
called `manifest.json`.

```
{
  "name": "Hello World",
  "devMode": true,
  "path": "~/Applications/hello.kdapp",
  "source": {
    "blocks": {
      "app": {
        "files": [
          "./index.coffee"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is a stripped down manifest file. Mature apps have many additional
flags, and before you publish you will want to include more, but this
is about as small as we could get.

You can place any number of source files into the `files` array, and
each coffee file will be compiled and concatenated to the `index.js` file,
*in the same order* that you define in your files array. It's important
to understand the order of this compilation, as variables must be defined
before you actually use them.

### Source Code

Next, create a file called `index.coffee` in your app directory, and copy
the following source code into it.

```
class HelloWorld extends JView
  constructor: ->
    super
    @hello = new KDHeaderView
      title: 'Hello World!'
      type: 'big'

  pistachio: ->
    """
    {{>@hello}}
    <p>
      Hello from our Hello App!
    </p>
    """

do ->
  appView.addSubView new HelloWorld()
```

Lets break down the above source. Remember, we are not trying to explain
the framework too much, just enough to make sense of the above code.

#### HelloWorld and Views

Views are Kodings way of programatically representing the DOM. Allowing you
to define elements and modify them all from your code. In the above code,
`KDHeaderView` will be literally compiled to `<h1>Hello World!</h1>`. You
can modify these views by adding css, changing their content, adding subviews,
or even removing them entirely at a later time.

The HelloWorld class will be what we tell Koding is our extension of a
Koding View. You can see that it extends `JView`, which is a Koding View.

#### JView and Pistachio

As we mentioned, `JView` is a Koding View. It extends `KDView`,
adding Pistachio functionality. [Pistachio][2] is a templating language
which is similar to Handlebars, and you can readup on it if you like.

The important thing to note here, is that `JView` and Pistachio *are entirely
optional*. I included them here to show multiple ways of adding content
to Koding Views. I could have included the `KDHeaderView` directly and
not used `JView` at all.

#### Do and appView

The `do` usage here is a bit irrelevant, but many Coffee users forget what
it actually *does*. `do ->` simple creates a javascript closure and executes
the given function immediately.

`appView` on the otherhand, is the real hero of this whole code. We've
explained that Koding uses views, and uses them everywhere, so it makes sense
that we need to add our main view, to another view. That's what `appView` is.

`appView` is provided in our applications scope, and we need to add our
application to it. This can be done with the method that all Views have,
`KDView.prototype.addSubView()`. We use it here, to add an instance of
our `HelloWorld` class to our apps container view.

### Compiling

Compiling can be done a number of ways. If you click **"Refresh Apps"**,
you should see your app listed in the apps list. From there, you can hover
over it and you will see little icons appear in the upper right, one of them
is a compile button. Each time you make changes, click this button to recompile
your app.

Another way to compile is to use `kdc` tool, in your Terminal. Simply run
`kdc ~/Applications/yourapp.kdapp` and `kdc` will compile your app. It's
worth noting that if you use this method, your browser's cached copy of
`index.js` may need to be force cleared manually with F5.

Lastly, as a shameless plug, i offer my compiling tool as a method to compile
your app during development. Check out the [AppAid Github][3] page for
installation instructions. Once installed, open AppAid, and simply select
your app from the list and click load. Compilation can be done automatically
from there.

## Closing

You should now know what Koding Applications are made of, what they are made
with, and how to make a basic Hello World application.

In the next installation, we'll take this a step further!
