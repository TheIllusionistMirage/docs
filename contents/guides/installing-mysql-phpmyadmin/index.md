In this tutorial i will go over setting up MySQL and phpMyAdmin, with
the Application, and Manually.


**Reminder**: As with all of these tutorials, they assume that there are no
conflicts. If you have previously attempted to install this software please
remove it fully or understand that conflicts may occur. Thanks :)



## Video

The following is an instructional video which approximately
mirrors the steps below. It covers both App, and Manual,
installations.

## What you will need

MySQL and phpyMyAdmin installation only requires knowledge of your Koding
username, your Koding password, and for phpMyAdmin, the VM connection url.
Your VM url will look like [http://username.kd.io](http://username.kd.io),
[http://vm-0.username.kd.io](http://vm-0.username.kd.io),
[http://vm-1.username.kd.io](http://vm-1.username.kd.io), etc. If you have
any questions on how you can find this, please watch the video, as i go
over the What You Need section in the beginning.



## Steps for Installing with the Koding App

The Koding App installation is the installation that most people will want.
It's the easiest, but will only work for your first VM currently. If you
need to install
MySQL and phpMyAdmin
on any VM other than your first, please see the Manual Installation
section below.

1. Navigate to [koding.com/Apps](https://koding.com/Apps) and select the
  MySQL Installer application, and click Install Now.

2. Navigate to [Your Apps](https://koding.com/Develop) and select your newly
  installed application, and in the upper right of the
  [application page](https://koding.com/Develop/MySQL%20Installer),
  click Install.
  
3. You will then be presented with a terminal on the bottom of your window.
  This terminal will be asking for your sudo password, which is Koding password,
  so enter that now. **Note** that even though it does not show you typing, it is
  still accepting your input.
  
4. At the next prompt, press Enter to accept the installation.
  
5. Next you will be prompted for your MySQL Root Password. After you have
  entered it, repeat the password at the next prompt.

6. The following prompt asks which web server to configure. Apache2 should
  already be selected, press Enter. What follows will be a lot of text,
  showing various installation messages.

7. Next you have to configure phpMyAdmin. This step will handle setting
  default configs up. Select Yes, and press Enter.

8. Now you have to give phpMyAdmin your **MySQL** Root Password. Next,
  type in the app password. This can be autogenerated, or hand selected.
  Enter or leave it blank, and press Enter.

9. You are almost done! Now MySQL and phpMyAdmin should be running! Your last
  step, is to configure Apache, to know where to look for phpMyAdmin. To do
  this, you can run the following command. It will need your password, so
  provide it when prompted:
  
  ```
  echo "Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf" | sudo tee -a /etc/apache2/apache2.conf && sudo service apache2 restart
  ```
  
  **Note:** You can select and copy this command with Ctrl-C, and paste it
  into your Terminal with Ctrl-*Shift*-V.

10. That's it! You should now have a working MySQL database, and you can
  connect to phpMyAdmin at the url
  [&lt;username&gt;.kd.io/phpMyAdmin](http://username.kd.io/phpMyAdmin)!



## Steps for Manual Installation

The manual steps only differ from the app steps by the first step. Due 
to this, i am going to simply provide the first step, and steps #2-10 can be
followed above in the **"Steps for Installing with the Koding App"** section.

1. First off, we are going to apt-get install mysql-server, mysql-client, and
  phpmyadmin. The command for that is as follows:
  `sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client phpmyadmin`

2. Follow App Installation steps above, #2 through #10 :)



## Confirming your Installation


### Confirming MySQL

You can connect to your MySQL server via the command line to ensure it is
running, and you know the username & password. To do this, type the following
command: `mysql -uroot -p<password>`, where `<password>` is your password,
without the brackets. If you are successful, you will be in the
mysql client, your terminal will look like `mysql> `, and your
MySQL server is running successfully. To leave, press **Ctrl-D**.

### Confirming phpMyAdmin

To confirm phpMyAdmin's correct installation, simply connect to
[http://username.kd.io/phpmyadmin](http://username.kd.io/phpmyadmin),
or if you installed on the non-default VM, connect to the vm directly via
[http://vm-1.username.kd.io/phpmyadmin](http://vm-1.username.kd.io/phpmyadmin),
[http://vm-2.username.kd.io/phpmyadmin](http://vm-2.username.kd.io/phpmyadmin),
etc. If you see phpMyAdmin, you have successfully installed phpMyadmin :)
