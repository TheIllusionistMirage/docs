This guide will go over the basics of submitting your Koding App, to the
main Koding Apps list. This is not about creation of the app, but merely
an evolving document focusing on App Submission.



## Publication Process

Publishing Applications to Koding currently requires overseeing from Koding
Staff. The general process looks like this:

1. Make a great app
2. Request app publisher rights
3. Submit app to be reviewed
4. The app gets published

Step 1 is obviously the start. Once you have made an app, tested it, and
find it complete, you can move on to two step. See below :)


## Becoming an App Publisher

Once you have an amazing app, you have to request to become an App Publisher.

This can be done by posting to the Koding Activity Feed, with the tag
`App Publishing`. The post should contain your App Name, Description,
and a link to the source on Github.

The Koding Staff will look into your app, and if it looks good enough you
be given Publishing rights. That's not the end of the road though!
After this, you have to publish and have the app reviewed, read below.



## Publishing & Review

After you are officially labeled as an App Publisher, you can now Publish
your app.

Open up [koding/Develop][0] and look in your FileTree for the
`~/Applications` directory. If you right click it, you will see a new
menu option titled *"Publish to App Catalog"*.

If you publish, your application will be uploaded to the main Koding
catalog but with a not-approved flag. This flag means that it will be awaiting
review from the Koding Staff. They will review it, and one of two things
will happen.

1. They do not approve your app. You will likely be contacted explaining
  why your app was not approved, and what you should improve/correct in
  the app to have it approved.

2. They approve your app! That's it! Once your app is approved, it will
  appear instantly for all Koding users to see.
