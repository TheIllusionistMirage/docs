This guide will go over what reinitializing is, and the ramifications and
advantages of using the feature. It's a good feature to know, and
understanding it will help you make decisions to make the best use of Koding
as possible. So, lets get started!

## What Is Reinitializing?

When you reinitialize a VM you reset it to "factory defaults", as it were.
It resets **everything** outside of your `/home` directory. This
includes removing, for example, mysql databases, phpmyadmin, installed
apt-get libraries, everything.

What does this do for you? Well, it's similar to wiping and reinstalling
a computers OS. You lose all of the installed programs, but you also fix any
odd behavior that may have been occuring on the OS. The computer might have
had broken libraries installed, bad programs, etc. By wiping everything,
you can easily start over, rather than trying to "fix" it all.
Reinitializing lets you do this, without losing any of your `/home` &
`/home/username` files!

Reinitializing is a powerful tool, and it's so freely and cheaply available
that it can be used to "fix things" quite easily.



## Reinitializing Experiment

For the sake of understanding what really happens, lets create a few files.
To do this, run the following command:

```
sudo touch ~/userdir.txt /home/homedir.txt /rootdir.txt
```

This created three files. One in the userdir called `userdir.txt`, one in
the home directory called `homedir.txt`, and one in the root directory
called `rootdir.txt`.

Now, reinitialize by clicking on your VM under **"Your Environments"** and
selecting **"Re-initialize VM"**. See the image below as reference.

Now lets look at what happened.

```

You'll notice that the `rootdir.txt` file has been removed from the root
directory, while the homedir and userdir files have been left intact!

This is all there really is to reinitializing. It removes everything
outside of your home directory, and returns it to factory defaults.
Setting up your environments to use your local namespace will allow
you to reinitialize anytime you want, which is pretty cool. I encourage it.



## Are there any 'Gotchas'?

There are no real Gotchas, it works perfectly as expected. The only real
confusion, is that sometimes people forget where something is actually
installed.

For example, if you install MySQL from apt-get then by default it is
not saving the database in your user directory. This is one of the bigger
points that you should understand. Unless you have set MySQL to use a
user directory as the storage location, and you reinitialize, you *will*
destroy your database. Same goes for any non-userspace storage.

In the future we may go over changing default locations for MySQL, MongoDB,
etc. However, currently i feel this is a bit outside the scope of these
guides. Nevertheless, feel free to
[make an issue on it](https://github.com/koding/docs/issues/new) and
request that it is covered in these guides. If there is enough interest,
i will gladly include it :)

For now though, please see Additional Resources below for various guides
we will be adding.
